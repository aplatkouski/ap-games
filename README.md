The AP Games is the result of the completion of the project
[Tic-Tac-Toe with AI][tic-tac-toe with ai] at
[JetBrains Academy][jetbrains academy]. This project was developed just for
fun and to learn Python and some concepts of a decision-making algorithm.

## Tic-Tac-Toe with AI + bonus **Reversi** game

Tic-tac-toe, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take
turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing
three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

### Reversi

Reversi is a strategy board game for two players who take turns marking the
spaces in an 8x8 board.

Each player must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of
opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces
between your pieces are then turned over to become your color. The object of
the game is to own more pieces than your opponent when the game is over.
See [source][reversi rules source].

The example below shows the game interface:

```shell script
python -m ap_games [game] [user-1 user-2]
```

Where:
  - ``game`` is a value from the following set:
    - ``1`` or ``tic-tac-toe`` for Tic-Tac-Toe game;
    - ``2`` or ``reversi`` for Reversi game.
  - ``user-1`` and ``user-2`` are values from the following set:
    - ``user`` for human player;
    - ``easy``, ``medium``, ``hard`` and ``nightmare`` for AI player.

**Note**: Parameters in brackets are optional.

Or open the python console and type:
```python

```

## Notes

This package can be run as a console game or integrated into another
application. This project provides the following basic structures:
  - ``SquareGameboard``
  - ``GameBase``
    - ``TicTacToe``
    - ``Reversi``
  - ``Player``
    - ``HumanPlayer``
    - ``AIPlayer`` - uses mini-max as decision-making algorithm.
